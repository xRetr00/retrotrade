# RetroTrade Overview

RetroTrade is a modular, extensible algorithmic trading framework designed for research and experimentation with reinforcement learning (RL), deep learning, and sentiment analysis models. The project supports multiple cryptocurrencies, risk management strategies, and real-time monitoring, making it suitable for both academic and practical trading system development.

## Goals
- Enable rapid prototyping of trading strategies
- Support integration of various ML and RL models
- Provide tools for risk management and sentiment analysis
- Facilitate research and educational use

## Key Concepts
- **Modular Design:** Each component (data, models, trading logic, risk, monitoring) is separated for easy extension and maintenance.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Supports PPO, GRU, and GARCH agents for trading strategy optimization.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrates NLP models for market sentiment signals.
- **Risk Management:** Customizable modules for position sizing, stop-loss, and portfolio risk.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time notifications and system health tracking.

## Typical Workflow
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Model training (RL, sentiment, risk)
3. Strategy simulation and backtesting
4. Live trading and monitoring
