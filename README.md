# RetroTrade

RetroTrade is a modular, extensible algorithmic trading framework designed for research and experimentation with reinforcement learning (RL), deep learning, and sentiment analysis models. The project supports multiple cryptocurrencies, risk management strategies, and real-time monitoring, making it suitable for both academic and practical trading system development.

**Note:** This project is not fully complete. Some models are provided as pre-trained and may require further development or fine-tuning.

## Features
- Modular architecture for easy extension and customization
- Support for RL agents (PPO, GRU, GARCH, etc.)
- Sentiment analysis integration
- Risk management modules
- Real-time monitoring and Telegram notifications
- Data processing and symbol discovery
- Pre-trained models included (PPO, GRU, Sentiment, Risk Management)
